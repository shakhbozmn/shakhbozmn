## 📱 Mobile Development with React Native, Fastlane, and RevenueCat  

I specialize in building and deploying cross-platform mobile applications using **React Native**, **Fastlane**, and **RevenueCat**. Here’s how I approach it:  

### **1. Cross-Platform Development**  
- **React Native** allows me to write code once and deploy it on both **iOS** and **Android**, saving time and resources.  
- **Expo** simplifies the development process with tools like over-the-air updates, pre-built components, and easy deployment.  

### **2. Fastlane for Automation**  
- **Fastlane** is my go-to tool for automating repetitive tasks like:  
  - Building and signing apps.  
  - Managing app store submissions.  
  - Running tests and generating screenshots.  
- This ensures a smooth and efficient deployment process, saving hours of manual work.  

### **3. RevenueCat for Monetization**  
- **RevenueCat** simplifies in-app purchases and subscription management.  
- I integrate RevenueCat to:  
  - Handle subscription logic effortlessly.  
  - Provide analytics and insights into revenue streams.  
  - Ensure a seamless user experience for monetization.  

### **4. Optimized Performance**  
- I focus on optimizing app performance by:  
  - Minimizing re-renders using **React.memo** and **useMemo**.  
  - Leveraging native modules for platform-specific optimizations.  
  - Using libraries like **React Native Reanimated** for smooth animations.  

### **5. Deployment Made Easy**  
- With **Expo EAS (Expo Application Services)**, I streamline the build and deployment process.  
- **Over-the-air (OTA) updates** ensure users always have the latest version without needing to download updates from the app store.
